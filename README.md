VertexVR is a cutting-edge landing page for a virtual reality software company, which I built using React and Tailwind CSS. A tutorial video on YouTube inspired this project, but I've added several custom features and modifications to enhance the user experience.
# 
# Key Features
- Smooth Scrolling Navigation: The navbar links seamlessly scroll the user to the corresponding sections of the page, providing a seamless and intuitive navigation experience.
- Responsive Design: The landing page is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Immersive Multimedia: The page features auto-playing videos and high-quality images that showcase the capabilities of the virtual reality software, immersing the user in the product's features.
- Customized Content: I have carefully curated the content, including the images, logo, icons, and videos, to align with the branding and messaging of the virtual reality software.
- Deployed on Vercel: I have successfully deployed the project on the Vercel platform, making it accessible to users worldwide.

# Technologies Used

- Vite: A fast and efficient build tool for modern web applications, which I used to set up the development environment.
